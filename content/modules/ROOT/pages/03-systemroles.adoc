== RHEL System Roles

If you haven’t used RHEL system roles in the past, you’ve been missing
out! System Roles are a collection of Ansible roles that will help you
perform server administration tasks using automation.

This collection of roles is included in RHEL, and use ansible-core to
execute, but can also be leveraged using Ansible Automation Platform.

In this step, we’re going to use the Podman system role, to deploy our
pod to a second host.

== Setup

We have created all of the files that you’ll need to make the automation
run, but let’s have a look at what we’re doing. Within the `+my-app+`
sub-directory you will find two new files, `+my-app-deploy.yaml+` and
`+inventory+`. These two files are all we’ll need to take our existing
definitions and get them up and running on our `+containerhost+`.

First, on our `+RHEL+` host, have a look at the `+inventory+` file.

[source,bash,run]
----
cd ~/my-app
cat inventory
----

You will see a very basic inventory, containing a host group called
`+ContainerHosts+` and a single host, `+containerhost+`

Now we will look at the real magic, the deployment playbook.

[source,bash,run]
----
cat my-app-deploy.yaml
----

A few things to note: `+hosts: ContainerHosts+` tells the playbook to
run on any host in the ContainerHosts host group

The above block tells the role that port 8080 will be used to listen for
requests for our pod. This will make sure that the `+containerhost+`
will open this port in its host-based firewall.

The above block tells the system role to deploy the files required to
deploy our pod under systemd via quadlet. It is important that files are
deployed in the order in which they are needed. For instance, the
quadlet, `+my-app.kube+`, requires both `+my-app-configmap.yaml+` and
`+my-app.yaml+`, so they must be defined first.

== Execute the playbook

Now why don’t we run the playbook, and deploy our pod. Remember that
this is going to deploy to our second host, which has nothing deployed
on it currently. Ansible is going to take that system from nothing, to
running our application in no time.

Run the following command

[source,bash,run]
----
ansible-playbook -i ./inventory ./my-app-deploy.yaml
----

____
_NOTE_: The execution of ansible-playbook will first attempt to connect
to `+containerhost+`. This will generate a question from ssh, asking
whether you accept `+containerhost+`’s ssh key. You will need to tell it
`+yes+` 

image:ssh-accept.png[Accept SSH Key]
____

You should see many lines of Ansible output as the playbook performs
different tasks on `+containerhost+`, and once it is complete you will
be returned to a bash prompt. This may take some time as podman pulls
down those container images.

If everything succeeded, we should see a play recap that does not
indicate any errors (OK, skipped, and changed are all good outputs here)
and now find our application running on `+containerhost+`.

== Testing for success

First, if we simply try to connect to the web page on `+containerhost+`
from `+rhel+` we should get the RHEL test page.

[source,bash,run]
----
curl http://containerhost:8080
----

Now, let’s switch to the ContainerHost tab, and look at podman.

After switching to the link:tab-1[button label="`ContainerHost`"
background="`#ee0000`" color="`#c7c7c7`"] tab, check the status in
systemd of the my-app service.

[source,bash,run]
----
systemctl --no-pager status my-app
----

You should see it up and running, we can also check podman.

[source,bash,run]
----
podman pod ps
----

== Making changes with Ansible.

We can also make changes within ansible. Let’s say that we made a
mistake and meant to forward port 80 to port 8080 on our container.
There are three places which we would have to set that. The quadlet
definition, the Kube yaml, and of course the deployment playbook. Let’s
switch to link:tab-2[button label="`File Browser`"
background="`#ee0000`" color="`#c7c7c7`"] and make those changes.

First, open up `+my-app.yaml+` and change line 15 from
`+hostPort: 8080+` to `+hostPort: 80+`. The changes will save
automatically.

Then head over to `+quadlet/my-app.kube+` and change line 8 from
`+PublishPort=8080:8080/tcp+` to `+PublishPort=80:8080/tcp+`. Again, the
changes will save automatically.

Finally, we’ll need to change the port that our ansible playbook opens,
in the `+my-app-deploy.yaml+` file chage line 9 from
`+- port: 8080/tcp+` to `+- port: 80/tcp+`.

Now head back to the link:tab-0[button label="`RHEL`"
background="`#ee0000`" color="`#c7c7c7`"] tab, and double-check that the
changes are correct.

[source,bash,run]
----
cd ~/my-app
cat my-app.yaml
cat quadlet/my-app.kube
cat my-app-deploy.yaml
----

Remember, the `+hostPort+` in the `+my-app.yaml+` should now be `+80+`,
and the `+PublishPort+` in the `+my-app.kube+` should now be
`+80:8080/tcp+`, lastly the `+port+` in `+my-app-deploy.yaml+` should be
`+80/tcp+`.

Now let’s run the playbook again to apply our changes. Ansible will push
the latest versions of our files to the managed host, and re-deploy our
containers.

[source,bash,run]
----
ansible-playbook -i inventory my-app-deploy.yaml
----

Once the playbook finishes, our application should be listening on port
80, we can test that with:

[source,bash,run]
----
curl http://containerhost:80
----

== Conclusion

In this lab we’ve taken a basic pod deployment in Podman, and turned it
into something that can be easily re-deployed time and time again with
automation. We hope you can see how these techniques might help you in
your day to day tasks.

Thank you!
